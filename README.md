# Scared Watcher

This Rain World mod simulates the uncontrollable fear that we all know inhabits our beloved slugcat, the Watcher.

This might serve as an interesting mechanic for a modded slugcat.
If anyone wants to use it for that purpose, feel free; just be warned that the code is a mess.
Ask me if you need help understanding/implementing it.
