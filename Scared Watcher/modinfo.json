  "description": "Makes Watcher act like a traumatized slugcat horrified by the strange things he sees.<LINE><LINE>Update 0.0.6: The Watcher is no longer a dependency; this mod can be configured to apply to any slugcat. Slugcats are now afraid of iterators. Added options to allow Watcher to freeze when frightened, instead of running away.<LINE><LINE>This mod was inspired by my controller glitching out in coincidentally creepy experiences, and I thought the effect was an awesome mechanic in the DLC (until I realized it was joystick drift, lol).<LINE><LINE>Note: This makes the Watcher slightly harder to control, especially in dangerous moments. You can tone down the effect in the config menu if you find it excessive.<LINE><LINE>Full feature list:<LINE>* Forces semi-random inputs if the slugcat is scared. The inputs are biased to make the slugcat run away from the danger.<LINE>* The slugcat calms down over time.<LINE>* The slugcat visibly shakes when scared.<LINE>* The slugcat blinks erratically when scared.<LINE>* The slugcat can hyperventilate after escaping a severe danger.<LINE>* The effect applies to Watcher and Slugpups by default, but can be applied to any slugcat in the config menu.<LINE>* The Watcher is afraid of: Echoes, Rot, Distortions/weird effects and lightning, Dangerous creatures in general (to a lesser degree), and Sudden sounds.",
